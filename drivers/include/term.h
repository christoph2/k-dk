!   The bottom line of the screen is used as a status line by the
    VT100 emulation.   The information on the bottom line is:

1)  the status of the four VT100 LED's
2)  the  status  of the numeric  keypad  (application mode /normal mode)
3)  the  status  of  the cursor  keypad  (application mode/normal  mode)


Interpreted Control Characters:

 *  ^N                shift out - selects G1 character set


VT100 KEYBOARD MAP

   The following table describes the special function keys of the 
VT100 and shows the transmitted sequences.  It also shows the key 
or  key sequence required to produce this function on the  IBM-PC 
keyboard.  The  VT100 has four function keys PF1 - PF4,  four arrow 
keys, and a numeric keypad with 0-9,  ".",  "-",  RETURN and  ",".
The numeric  keypad  and  the arrow keys may be in standard  mode or 
applications mode as set by the host computer.  Sequences will be 
sent as follows:
